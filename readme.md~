Welcome to the Santander Repository. 
THis is the code I have been working on for the past few weeks. So cross_valid.py is essentially a script I'm working on to be able to predict the our models score without having to upload it to Kaggle (therefore not waste submissions) and for partitioning the training set for stacking. feature importance .png is essentially just an image showing the relative importance of variables. pca.py is a script I pulled off the Kaggle message boards which is an ensemble of several models, unfortunately by itself it does not score well but I'm hoping to stack it with the XGB in R. var_en is what I've been using for my attempts at feature engineering. Basically it created several new categorical features.  tester.py the script that made the feature importance histogram. I used this in conjuction with var_en to measure the new features. Ufortunately none of these "new" features have increased LB score. If you have any other questions about anything feel free to ask. 

.841644 LB soon
