Welcome to the Santander Repository. 
THis is the code I have been working on for the past few weeks. So cross_valid.py is essentially a script I'm working on to be able to predict the our models score without having to upload it to Kaggle (therefore not waste submissions) and for partitioning the training set for stacking. feature importance .png is essentially just an image showing the relative importance of variables. pca.py is a script I pulled off the Kaggle message boards which is an ensemble of several models, unfortunately by itself it does not score well but I'm hoping to stack it with the XGB in R. tester.py
